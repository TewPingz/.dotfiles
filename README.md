# Dotfiles

My dotfiles, nothing special but the setup lets me have a config for both my laptop and PC.

If my PC is being used I split my ultrawide display into 3 virtual displays allowing the middle one to be a 2560x1440 which allows me to share my whole middle screen instead of doing individual tabs.
